virtualisation is creating virtual instances of various services like servers or operating systems using own system resources

it is done using hypervisors

we can share our system's resources like RAM and HDD with the virtual machine we use


hypervisors are of 2 types 
type 1
eg: dual boot
we can assign greater number of resources than we actually have to the virtual machines but each machine can't be assigned resources greater than total availiable resource

type 2
eg: vm ware
these run inside the main os and total memory can't be assigned more than the availiable memory
