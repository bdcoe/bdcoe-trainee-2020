    ___~ DATA STRUCTURE~__

LINKED LIST:

 Linked list is a linear data structure .Unlike arrays,Linked list elements are not stored at a contagious location;the lements are linked 
 using pointer .

WHY SHOULD WE USE LINKED LIST ?

--> Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have following limitations:
1. The size of the array is fixed,so we must know the upper limit .
2. Inserting a new element in the array is expensive because new room has to be created for new elements and others needed to  be shifted .

ADVATAGES OF LINKED LIST OVER ARRAYS :
1.Dynamic size 
2.Ease of insertion/deletion

CREATION OF LINKED LIST :

in c:
 struct node{
    int data;
     struct node* next;
};
  
in cpp:
class Node {

      public:
          int data;
          Node* next ;
}:

chocolate tip:  what does this function do?
void fun1(struct node* head)
{
  if(head==null)                                    [PRINTS ALL NODES OF LINKED LIST IN REVERSE ORDER....]
  return;
  fun1(head-->next);
  printf("%d ",head->data);
  }
